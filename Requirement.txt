The `requirements.txt` file lists all Python libraries and their versions needed to run the code in your repository.
For a deep learning project like this, it typically includes packages for data handling, model building, and sometimes specific utilities for data visualization or handling specific types of neural networks. 
Here’s an example `requirements.txt` for the deep learning repository described:

# Core Libraries
numpy==1.21.2
pandas==1.3.3
scipy==1.7.1

# Deep Learning Frameworks
tensorflow==2.6.0
torch==1.9.0      # For PyTorch-based implementations, if needed

# Transformers (for Transformer-based models)
transformers==4.10.0

# Image Processing
opencv-python==4.5.3.56

# Visualization
matplotlib==3.4.3
seaborn==0.11.2

# Utility Libraries
scikit-learn==0.24.2
```

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each library’s version is specified to ensure consistency and compatibility with your code. 
Adjust the versions based on your specific needs and compatibility with your deep learning frameworks.
